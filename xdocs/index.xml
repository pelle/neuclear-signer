        <section name="Road Map">
            <p>
                Our aim for the next version 0.9 is to stabilize and freeze the underlying xml formats and standards as well
                as to create more userland tools. Thus the goal is to fix the underlying format making it easier for other implementations
                of NeuClear ID. This should be reached early on in January 2004
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal is for 1.0 the following release to be fairly polished from a usability standpoint. Our goal is to release this
                in February 2004.
